# ECE411
My work for ECE411 at UIUC

THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY OTHER STUDENTS IN CURRENT OR FUTURE CLASSES OF ECE411 AT UIUC!!! I AM INTENTIONALLY NOT UPDATING EVERYTHING ON THE REPO UNTIL AFTER THE CHECKPOINT IN WHICH MY WORK IS DUE.  I AM USING THIS REPO AS A WAY TO SYNCRONIZE MY WORK ON MY HOME MACHINE TO MY WORK ON THE EWS LABS FOR WHEN I AM HOME AND NOT ON CAMPUS (MOST OF THE TIME).  THIS CODE IS BAD.  DO NOT USE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE, AND FOR ETHICAL REASONS.  DO NOT USE OTHER PEOPLE'S CODE FOR YOUR OWN HOMEWORK.  THAT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE AND ENSURES YOUR STUPIDITY. YOU ARE PAYING AN ASSLOAD OF MONEY AND RISKING YOUR FUTURE WITH MASSIVE DEBT FOR YOUR EDUCATION.  DO NOT WASTE THAT MONEY BY USING OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK AS YOUR OWN.
